This repository contains a project that was done as part of a hackathon in Dallas with the focus on aiding in sustainability and assisting people with becoming more energy efficient. 

This was done on a team of 4 people and we decided to design a web app that would help people perform what's called a "self-energy audit"...

Basically, a user would create a profile on our website and enter basic information on their appliances. Once that was done, we would use an API to communicate with a DocumentDB database and store their information within the database. When they changed appliances, we would show the user the impact on their energy usage that upgrading that appliance had by communicating with the database again and comparing the old appliance to the new appliance.
